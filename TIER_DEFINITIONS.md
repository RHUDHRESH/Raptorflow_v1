# RaptorFlow Subscription Tiers - Canonical Definition

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Locked - Production Binding

---

## Philosophy

All tiers receive the **core thinking brain** of RaptorFlow: strategy, positioning, offer design, persona clarity, and objection handling. We never cripple the strategy layer. The differences between tiers are:
- **Scale** (quotas, projects, personas)
- **Collaboration** (editor slots, team governance)
- **Depth** (analysis breadth, automation, tracking)
- **Channels** (dispatch destinations)

This "good → better → best with clear steps up" drives upgrades and keeps margins healthy because the value difference is obvious and not arbitrary feature gating.

## What Every Tier Gets (Non-Negotiables)

### Strategy Workspace
Everyone gets full access to:
- **ICP & Persona Studio** - Define buyer profiles
- **Positioning / Point of View** - What we stand for, what we promise, how we prove it
- **Offer & Pricing Builder** - Package value, set pricing, justify it
- **PMF Pulse & Cadence Planner** - Weekly talking points and timing
- **Category Mapper** - Where we sit in the market
- **Anti-Persona Guard** - Who we explicitly don't sell to
- **Wedge Finder** - Where we win first
- **Objection Map** - Pain → answer with proof

### Evidence Locker (Storage by Tier)
Ingest proof: site URLs, PDFs, reviews, competitor pages.
- Break into searchable chunks
- Embed for semantic search
- Cite back into messaging to prevent hallucinations
- Export assets + citations bundle

Capacity:
- **Breeze:** 10k chunks
- **Glide:** 50k chunks
- **Soar:** 100k chunks

### Message Matrix & Copy Studio
Take personas + funnel stages → messaging angles (hooks, pains, CTAs, proof points).

Two generation modes (automatic upgrade based on request):
- **Light Assets:** ~350 words, one-pass, no live crawl, Evidence Locker + saved voice only
- **Pro Assets:** ~900 words, two-pass refinement, up to 5 fresh URLs + Evidence Locker

### Dispatch & Tracking (Baseline)
- Schedule content to go out
- Auto-generate UTMs for later attribution
- Log all dispatches for measurement

### Lift (Baseline)
Compare "before" vs "after" on KPIs (CTR, CVR, etc.)
- "This beat that" stories
- Kill underperformers, scale winners

## Implementation Notes

### Research Run Definition
A "research run" = pulling voice-of-customer, competitor snapshot, objection harvest, SOSTAC analysis, or evidence gathering. One API call = one run.

### Asset Generation
- Light assets count as 1 asset
- Pro assets count as 1 asset (not tiered counting)
- Batch generation counts toward monthly quota
- Overage: can purchase additional packs or upgrade tier

### Editor Concurrency
- Breeze: Solo operator + 2 approvers (no concurrent editor limits)
- Glide: 3 people can edit simultaneously from the shared pool
- Soar: 5 people can edit simultaneously from the shared pool
- If a user tries to exceed slots, queue them or prompt upgrade

### Channel Support
- Breeze: 1 of (Email, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Slack, Zapier)
- Glide: 2 of the above
- Soar: 3 of the above
- Future: Add YouTube, TikTok, Discord, etc. (not in initial launch)

### Approval Workflows
- Breeze: 2 guest approvers (lightweight, view-only comments)
- Glide: 2 designated approvers (formal review process)
- Soar: Approval history export + role-based permissions (audit trail for compliance)

---

## Grandfathering & Migration

- Existing customers on "Basic/Pro/Enterprise" should be mapped:
  - Basic → Breeze (or migrate with 6-month notice)
  - Pro → Glide
  - Enterprise → Soar
- Offer 1-month trial period for customers to test new tier names
- No automatic downgrade; let them choose on renewal

---

## Future Roadmap (Not in Scope)

- Per-seat pricing (we will NOT do this; pooled concurrency is our moat)
- Feature striping below Breeze (no free tier)
- Overage metering (v2: can be added, but start with simple limits)
- Usage-based pricing add-on (v2 consideration)

## Questions? Lock It

This document is the source of truth for all tier definitions. Update this file if specs change, and notify:
- Backend team (tier enforcement in API)
- Frontend team (UI messaging, quota displays)
- Sales/Support (pricing, limit messaging)
- Finance (renewal logic, upgrade paths)

**Do not** create custom tier definitions in code. Reference this document.
