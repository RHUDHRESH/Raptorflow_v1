## ⬜ TODO: REFACTOR EXISTING FILES (1-2 hours)

### 1. Update `backend/agents/content_router_agent.py` → Use Shared Modules
**File:** `backend/agents/content_router_agent.py`
**Current Size:** 550 lines
**Target Size:** 150 lines (73% reduction)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Replace lines 23-57 (word lists) with import from `sentiment_analyzer_shared`
- [ ] Replace lines 104-110 (duplicate _analyze_content) with call to `SharedSentimentAnalyzer.analyze_content()`
- [ ] Replace lines 134-178 (duplicate _assess_tone) with call to `SharedSentimentAnalyzer.analyze_tone()`
- [ ] Delete lines 252-478 (10 duplicate _score_* methods)
- [ ] Add import: `from backend.shared.platform_scorer_unified import UnifiedPlatformScorer`
- [ ] Add import: `from backend.shared.analysis_cache import analysis_cache`
- [ ] Add call to: `UnifiedPlatformScorer.score_all_platforms()`
- [ ] Test that output matches original

**Verification:**
```python
# Test that sentiment analysis still works
result = await content_router.analyze_and_route(
    business_id="test",
    content="I hate this!",
    content_type="venting",
    business_data={},
    icps=[]
)
assert result["success"] == True
assert result["analysis"]["sentiment"]["type"] == "negative"
```

---

### 2. Update `backend/tools/sentiment_tone_analyzer.py` → Use Shared Sentiment
**File:** `backend/tools/sentiment_tone_analyzer.py`
**Actions:**
- [ ] Replace SentimentToneAnalyzerTool class with wrapper
- [ ] Import from `backend.shared.sentiment_analyzer_shared`
- [ ] Delegate to `SharedSentimentAnalyzer` for actual analysis
- [ ] Keep only the public interface same

**Example:**
```python
from backend.shared.sentiment_analyzer_shared import SharedSentimentAnalyzer

class SentimentToneAnalyzerTool(BaseTool):
    async def _execute(self, content: str, detailed: bool = False, **kwargs):
        # Just delegate to shared analyzer
        analysis = SharedSentimentAnalyzer.analyze_content(content)

        if detailed:
            # Add any additional detailed analysis
            pass

        return analysis
```

---

### 3. Update `backend/agents/moves_content_agent_enhanced.py`
**File:** `backend/agents/moves_content_agent_enhanced.py`
**Actions:**
- [ ] Replace lines 200-226 (sentiment detection) with `SharedSentimentAnalyzer`
- [ ] Replace lines 187-226 (_calculate_platform_score) with `UnifiedPlatformScorer`
- [ ] Delete duplicate word lists (positive_words, negative_words)
- [ ] Test output still matches

---

### 4. Update `backend/api/content_routing_routes.py` → Use v1 Design
**File:** `backend/api/content_routing_routes.py`
**Current:** 11 endpoints with overlapping logic
**Target:** Use v1 design (4 focused endpoints)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Backup current file: `content_routing_routes_old.py`
- [ ] Either:
  - Option A: Gradually replace endpoints in current file
  - Option B: Use new file `content_routing_routes_v1.py` going forward
- [ ] Consolidate endpoints:
  - [x] `/analyze` + `/recommend-platforms` + `/route-content` → `/analyze` (v1)
  - [x] `/distribute-multi-platform` + `/bulk-schedule` → `/distribute` (v1)
  - [x] `/adjust-tone` → `/adjust-tone` (v1)
  - [x] `/trending-topics` + `/best-times-to-post` + `/content-templates` → `/metadata` (v1)
- [ ] Test all endpoints

---

- [ ] Test API v1 endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow: content → analysis → recommendations → distribution

### 3. Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure token usage before/after
  - [ ] Before (old system): ~300 tokens per request
  - [ ] After (optimized): ~80 tokens per request
  - [ ] Target: 73% reduction

- [ ] Measure latency before/after
  - [ ] Before: 3 seconds (multiple passes)
  - [ ] After: <1 second (single pass + caching)

- [ ] Measure cache performance
  - [ ] Repeated requests should be near-instant (<10ms)
  - [ ] Cache hit rate should be 40-60%

- [ ] Refactor content_router_agent.py (45 min)
- [ ] Refactor sentiment_tone_analyzer.py (30 min)
- [ ] Refactor moves_content_agent_enhanced.py (30 min)
- [ ] Update API routes (30 min)

### Day 2 (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Write unit tests (1 hour)

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If something breaks:

1. **Identified during testing:**
   - Simply don't merge the changes
   - Keep using old system

2. **After production deployment:**
   - [ ] Have backups of original files
   - [ ] Can quickly revert with: `git revert <commit-hash>`
   - [ ] Old API endpoints remain functional
   - [ ] No data loss (cache is ephemeral)

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

All of these must be true to consider Phase 1 complete:

- [ ] Code duplication reduced from 25% to <5%
- [ ] Token usage reduced by 40% (from ~300 to ~80 per request)
- [ ] Cache hit rate achieves 40-60%
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] API endpoints functional and backward compatible
- [ ] No regressions (same functionality, better performance)
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

- Platform scoring: ~100 tokens (10 separate methods)
- Total per request: ~300 tokens
- With 5 similar requests: 1,000 tokens (no caching)

- Cache hit rate: 0%
```

### After Phase 1
```
File Structure:

- sentiment_analyzer_shared.py (230 lines, single source)
- platform_scorer_unified.py (280 lines, single source)

Token Usage:
- Sentiment analysis: ~80 tokens (single pass)
- Platform scoring: ~20 tokens (unified scorer)
- Total per request: ~80 tokens
- With 5 similar requests: ~88 tokens (with caching)
- Savings: 1,000 - 88 = 912 tokens (91% reduction!)

Performance:
- Average latency: <1 second (with cache)
- Cache hit rate: 40-60%
- Repeated requests: <10ms
```

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Don't break the old system** - Keep both v1 and v2 running during transition
2. **Test thoroughly** - Use comprehensive test cases
3. **Measure everything** - Track tokens, cache, latency
4. **Document well** - Each change should be clearly documented
5. **Go step by step** - Don't try to do everything at once
6. **Ask for help** - If anything is unclear, refer to documentation

---

**Status:** Ready to begin
**Estimated Time to Complete:** 4-5 hours
**Expected ROI:** 3,000+ tokens saved, 40% reduction in token usage
**Next Step:** Start with Day 1 tasks
