### Breeze → Glide
✓ You hired someone / you're getting team input
✓ You have more than 5 projects
✓ You need more than 40 assets/month
✓ You want QR codes for offline/print campaigns
✓ You want strategy heatmaps to argue positioning with confidence

### Glide → Soar
✓ You're running multiple clients (need 5 personas, 200 assets/mo)
✓ You need to automate multi-step workflows (Batch Recipes)
✓ You need audit trails for compliance / client reviews
✓ You're running performance experiments and need rotators
✓ You need competitive intelligence (Competitor Watch + Market Pulse)
✓ You have 5+ people editing (need more editor slots)

## Key Implementation Notes

### Research Runs
One "research run" = one call to pull voice-of-customer, competitor snapshot, objection harvest, SOSTAC, or evidence gathering.

### Assets
- Light = 1 asset count
- Pro = 1 asset count (not 2x)
- Auto-upgrade: if you ask for long-form or fresh crawl, Light → Pro automatically (quality + cost protection)

### Channels
Pick 1 (Breeze), 2 (Glide), or 3 (Soar) from: Email, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Slack, Zapier.
Future: YouTube, TikTok, Discord (not launch v1).

### Editor Concurrency
- **Breeze:** Solo operator. 2 approvers can view/comment but don't generate.
- **Glide:** Up to 3 people editing at once. If 4th person tries, queue them or suggest upgrade.
- **Soar:** Up to 5 people editing at once. Same queueing rule.

## Pricing Ladder

```
Breeze  ₹1,499/mo   (entry, solo, clarity)
Glide   ₹2,499/mo   (team, unlimited projects, pooled editors)
Soar    ₹4,999/mo   (operation, automation, audit trails)
```

**No free tier.** Entry point is Breeze.
**No per-seat add-ons.** Pooled concurrency is our moat.
