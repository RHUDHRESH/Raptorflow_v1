THE PHILOSOPHY:
===============

We never cripple the thinking brain (strategy, positioning, offer design).
All tiers get full access to the core value of RaptorFlow.

Tiers differ in:
  1. SCALE (quotas: projects, assets, personas, research runs)
  2. COLLABORATION (editor slots, team size, permission models)
  3. DEPTH (analysis breadth: Stress-Test, Heatmap, Watch, Pulse, Ladder Sim)
  4. CHANNELS (dispatch destinations: 1 → 2 → 3)
  5. AUTOMATION (Batch Recipes on Soar only)

This drives upgrades naturally:
  • Breeze → Glide: Hired someone? Need more assets? Want QR codes?
  • Glide → Soar: Multiple clients? Need automation? Need audit trails?


WHY THESE PRICES?
=================

₹1,499 (Breeze):  Entry point. Solo founder can get started without hesitation.
₹2,499 (Glide):   +₹1,000 for team collaboration + advanced strategy. 67% more.
₹4,999 (Soar):    +₹2,500 for automation + audit + 5 personas. 2x Glide.

Pricing reflects:
  • Editor slot concurrency (key cost differentiator in SaaS)
  • Capacity increases (storage, quotas, processing)
  • Support tier (priority for Soar)
  • Audit/compliance features (Soar only)


WHY NO FREE TIER?
=================

RaptorFlow is not a toy. Entry is Breeze at ₹1,499.

Benefits:
  ✓ No freemium complexity (support burden, unclear upgrade path)
  ✓ Clear monetization from day 1
  ✓ Signals product is serious/valuable
  ✓ Attracts right customer (professional, funded)
  ✓ Easier support (paid users have skin in the game)


WHY POOLED EDITOR SLOTS INSTEAD OF PER-SEAT PRICING?
====================================================

Per-seat pricing (₹X/user/month) becomes:
  ✗ Confusing: Do I pay ₹500/user on Glide? ₹1000? ₹100?
  ✗ Revenue leak: Teams hide users, use shared accounts
  ✗ Support nightmare: "Why am I charged for 5 people if only 3 are active?"

Pooled slots (3 concurrent editors on Glide, 5 on Soar):
  ✓ Clear: Max 3 people editing at once
  ✓ Fair: You pay for team capacity, not headcount
  ✓ Simple: No seat management UI
  ✓ Revenue stable: Customer pays for tier, not for adding people


HOW TIER MIGRATION WORKS:
=========================

Existing customers on old tiers (Basic/Pro/Enterprise):
  → Will be migrated to Breeze/Glide/Soar on next renewal
  → Or offered 1-month trial of new tier names
  → No forced immediate upgrade; customer choice

Pricing update:
  → Old Basic customers: might see price change to ₹1,499 (from ?)
  → Old Pro customers: might see price change to ₹2,499 (from ?)
  → Old Enterprise customers: might see price change to ₹4,999 (from ?)

TEAM NEXT STEPS:
================

Backend Team:
  [ ] Read TIER_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md
  [ ] Phase 1: Build quota validation middleware
  [ ] Phase 1: Build feature gating middleware
  [ ] Phase 2: Update subscription endpoint to return tier config
  [ ] Phase 3: Run database migration (basic→breeze, pro→glide, enterprise→soar)
  [ ] Phase 4: Update Razorpay webhook for new tier names
  [ ] Add tests for tier enforcement

Frontend Team:
  [ ] Read TIER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  [ ] Update pricing page: ₹1,499 / ₹2,499 / ₹4,999
  [ ] Update tier display in dashboard
  [ ] Update feature availability checks
  [ ] Add "Upgrade" buttons with upgrade path messaging
  [ ] Update onboarding to explain tiers

Sales/Support Team:
  [ ] Print TIER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  [ ] Read TIER_DEFINITIONS.md
  [ ] Learn upgrade triggers (Breeze→Glide, Glide→Soar)
  [ ] Update sales deck with new tier names
  [ ] Update support docs with tier-specific feature lists

Product/Finance Team:
  [ ] Decide: Grandfather existing customers at old price? Or migrate?
  [ ] Plan customer communication (email, in-app, support)
  [ ] Update Razorpay plan mapping
  [ ] Track upgrade rates (KPI: how many Breeze → Glide per month?)


CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT BREAK):
==============================

1. NEVER modify tier specs in code without updating TIER_DEFINITIONS.md first
2. ALL tier configs go through backend/utils/subscription_tiers.py
3. NO hardcoded tier logic scattered across the codebase
4. NO new tiers without reviewing with product/finance/leadership
5. If specs change, update TIER_DEFINITIONS.md → backend code → communicate teams


HOW TO UPDATE TIERS (IF NEEDED):
================================

1. Update /TIER_DEFINITIONS.md with new specs
2. Update /backend/utils/subscription_tiers.py with new config
3. Update /TIER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md with new summary
4. Notify all teams (Backend, Frontend, Sales, Product, Finance)
5. Create git commit with detailed message
6. DO NOT deploy until all teams have reviewed


QUESTIONS? READ THIS:
=====================

Q: Why Breeze/Glide/Soar names?
A: Better than "Basic/Pro/Enterprise." More distinctive, less clinical.

Q: What if someone wants a 4th editor slot on Glide?
A: Upgrade to Soar (5 slots for ₹4,999). That's the designed upgrade path.

Q: Can we offer overage billing (pay for extra assets)?
A: Not in v1. Keep it simple: Breeze/Glide/Soar or upgrade. Add metering in v2 if needed.

Q: How do we handle existing customers on old tiers?
A: Product/Finance decision. Recommend: 1-month trial period, then let them choose.

Q: What if a customer is on Breeze but needs features from Soar?
A: They upgrade. Or we build a Soar feature and offer them a trial. No in-between tiers.

Q: Can we remove a feature from a higher tier to make room for a lower tier?
A: NO. Features only go down, never back up. What Breeze gets, Glide/Soar keep + add more.
