        POSITIONING PRINCIPLES (Ries, Trout, Godin, Burnett, Ogilvy)

        1. LAW OF FOCUS (Ries & Trout)
           Own a single word in the prospect's mind.
           Examples: Volvo = Safety, FedEx = Overnight, Coca-Cola = Happiness
           Strategy: Narrow focus to create a strong position

        2. LAW OF THE OPPOSITE
           If you can't be first, be the opposite.
           Example: Avis "We're #2, we try harder"
           Strategy: Define against the leader

        3. LAW OF THE CATEGORY
           If you can't be first in a category, create a new category.
           Example: Gatorade created "sports drink" category
           Strategy: Own the category you're pioneering

        4. LAW OF THE NAME
           The name should reflect the positioning.
           Example: Expensive, exclusive brands have simple, memorable names
           Strategy: Name telegraphs the positioning

        5. PURPLE COW (Seth Godin)
           Be remarkable. Most businesses are "very good" - boring.
           Strategy: Something worth talking about, worth spreading

        6. PERMISSION MARKETING
           Earn the privilege to market to interested people.
           Not: interrupt, surprise, push
           Strategy: Anticipate, personal, relevant communication

        7. INHERENT DRAMA (Leo Burnett)
           Every product has drama within it.
           Strategy: Find the human truth behind the product

        8. BIG IDEA (Leo Burnett)
           Create one powerful, simple idea.
           Strategy: Unforgettable, builds brand equity

        9. RESEARCH FIRST (David Ogilvy)
           Study the product until you find the benefit.
           Not guesses, not gut feel - facts.
           Strategy: Evidence-based positioning

        10. PROMISE A BENEFIT
            Don't list features. Tell them what it does for their life.
            Not: "5MP camera" â†’ "Capture memories that last forever"
            Strategy: Emotion + benefit, not specs
