# Positioning Principles for Strategic Analysis

## Ries & Trout - The Laws of Positioning

1. THE LAW OF FOCUS: Own a word in the prospect's mind. Volvo owns "safety", FedEx owns "overnight". The most powerful concept is to narrow the focus, to concentrate on a single word or concept.

2. THE LAW OF SACRIFICE: You must give something up to get something. There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and constant change. Narrow your focus to build a position.

3. THE LAW OF THE CATEGORY: If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in. When launching a new product, the first question to ask is: what category is this new product first in?

4. THE LAW OF THE OPPOSITE: If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader. Look for the essence of the leader and present the opposite.

## Seth Godin - Purple Cow & Permission Marketing

5. BE REMARKABLE: The opposite of remarkable is very good. Nobody talks about very good anymore. To succeed, create something remarkable enough that people choose to talk about it.

6. EARN PERMISSION: Don't interrupt strangers, earn the privilege of marketing to people who actually want to hear from you. Permission marketing is anticipated, personal, and relevant.

7. FIND YOUR TRIBE: Don't market to everyone. Find the smallest viable audience - people who will care deeply about what you offer. Lead them, connect them.

## Leo Burnett - Human Truth & Drama

8. INHERENT DRAMA: Every product has drama within it. The creative person's job is to dig down to find the inherent drama - the reason the product was created in the first place.

9. THE BIG IDEA: Great advertising comes from a big idea that makes the product unforgettable. The idea should be simple, surprising, and built on human truth.

## David Ogilvy - Research & Benefits

10. RESEARCH FIRST: Study the product until you find the benefit that makes it desirable. Don't guess - research. "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore enemy signals."

11. PROMISE A BENEFIT: Give the consumer a benefit - a reason to buy your product. Don't just list features. Tell them what the product will do for their life.
