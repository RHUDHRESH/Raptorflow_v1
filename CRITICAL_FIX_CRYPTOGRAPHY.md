# Critical Fix: Cryptography Version

## Issue
The deployment was failing because `requirements.txt` specified `cryptography==41.0.8`, which does not exist on PyPI.

## Error Messages
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cryptography==41.0.8
ERROR: No matching distribution found for cryptography==41.0.8
```

## Fix Applied
Changed `backend/requirements.txt` line 37:
```diff
- cryptography==41.0.8
+ cryptography==41.0.7
```

## Available Versions
- Last 41.x version: **41.0.7** ✅ (now using this)
- Next version: **42.0.0** (newer, but may have breaking changes)

## Verification
```bash
grep cryptography backend/requirements.txt
# Output: cryptography==41.0.7
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit this change
2. Push to trigger re-deployment
3. Deployment should now succeed

## Commit Command
```bash
git add backend/requirements.txt
git commit -m "fix: update cryptography to valid version 41.0.7"
git push origin main
```
