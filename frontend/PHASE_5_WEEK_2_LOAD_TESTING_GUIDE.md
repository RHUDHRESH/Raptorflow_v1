# 🎯 Phase 5 Week 2: Load Testing & Performance Validation Guide

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅
**Week:** 2 of 4
**Deliverables:** 4 load test scripts + comprehensive guide
**Coverage:** 4 test scenarios with different load patterns

---

## 📋 Overview

Week 2 establishes comprehensive load testing infrastructure using k6, covering:
- Baseline performance testing
- Spike testing (sudden traffic increases)
- Stress testing (finding breaking point)
- Realistic workflow simulation
- Performance metrics baseline establishment

---

## 🧪 Load Test Scripts Created

### 1. Baseline Test (`baseline.js`)

**Purpose:** Establish normal performance baseline with moderate load

**Load Pattern:**
```
Stage 1: 0 → 10 users over 2 minutes (warm up)
Stage 2: 10 → 50 users over 5 minutes (ramp up)
Stage 3: 50 users sustained for 5 minutes (steady state)
Stage 4: 50 → 0 users over 2 minutes (ramp down)
Total Duration: 14 minutes
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Homepage load
- Strategy page load
- API endpoint performance
- Error handling

**Performance Thresholds:**
```
✅ p95 Response Time: < 500ms
✅ p99 Response Time: < 1000ms
✅ Error Rate: < 10%
✅ Success Rate: > 90%
```

**Expected Results (Post Phase 4 Optimization):**
```
Concurrent Users:     50
Requests/Second:      100+
Response Time (avg):  200-300ms
Response Time (p95):  400-500ms
Error Rate:           < 5%
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
k6 run load-tests/baseline.js
```

---

### 2. Spike Test (`spike.js`)

**Purpose:** Test system behavior under sudden traffic spikes

**Load Pattern:**
```
Stage 1: 5 users normal (1 minute)
Stage 2: 5 → 100 users spike (30 seconds) ⚡
Stage 3: 100 users sustained (1 minute)
Stage 4: 100 → 5 users recovery (30 seconds)
Stage 5: Wind down to 0 (1 minute)
Total Duration: 4 minutes
```

**Key Insight:** Simulates sudden traffic spike (like news article mention, viral content)

**Performance Thresholds (Lenient for Spike):**
```
✅ p95 Response Time: < 1000ms
✅ p99 Response Time: < 2000ms
✅ Error Rate: < 15%
✅ System Recovery: Within 30 seconds after spike
```

**Expected Results:**
```
Peak Concurrent Users:    100
Max Response Time:        1000-2000ms
Error Rate During Spike:  10-15%
Recovery Time:            30 seconds
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
k6 run load-tests/spike.js
```

---

### 3. Stress Test (`stress.js`)

**Purpose:** Find system breaking point and limits

**Load Pattern:**
```
Stage 1: 10 users normal (2 minutes)
Stage 2: 10 → 100 users (5 minutes) Gradual increase
Stage 3: 100 → 200 users (5 minutes) More stress
Stage 4: 200 → 300 users (5 minutes) Peak stress
Stage 5: 300 → 0 users (3 minutes) Ramp down
Total Duration: 20 minutes
```

**Key Insight:** Identifies where system starts degrading

**Performance Thresholds (Very Lenient):**
```
✅ p99 Response Time: < 3000ms
✅ Error Rate: < 30%
✅ System doesn't crash: Must remain available
```

**Expected Breaking Points:**
```
Safe Zone:        50-100 users
Degradation:      100-200 users
Critical:         200-300 users
Breaking Point:   300+ users
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
k6 run load-tests/stress.js
```

---

### 4. Workflow Test (`workflow.js`)

**Purpose:** Simulate realistic user journeys with actual business logic

**User Workflow:**
```
1. Login to application
2. Load workspace list
3. Load strategy data
4. Submit analysis request
5. Fetch analysis results
```

**Load Pattern:**
```
Stage 1: 0 → 20 users (2 minutes) Warm up
Stage 2: 20 → 50 users (10 minutes) Ramp up
Stage 3: 50 users sustained (5 minutes) Steady state
Stage 4: 50 → 0 users (2 minutes) Ramp down
Total Duration: 19 minutes
```

**Custom Metrics Tracked:**
```
workflow_duration:  Time to complete full user workflow
login_success:      Login success rate
analysis_success:   Analysis request success rate
active_users:       Current active virtual users
```

**Performance Thresholds:**
```
✅ Workflow Duration (p95): < 8 seconds
✅ Login Success Rate: > 95%
✅ Analysis Success Rate: > 90%
✅ Response Time: < 1 second per request
```

**Expected Results:**
```
Concurrent Users:         50
Workflow Completion:      6-8 seconds
Success Rate:             > 95%
Failed Workflows:         < 5%
Login Success:            > 95%
```

**Run Command:**
```bash
k6 run load-tests/workflow.js
```

## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Interpreting Results

**✅ Good Performance**
```
- p95 Response < 500ms at 50 concurrent users
- Error rate < 5%
- System recovers from spike in < 30 sec
- No memory leaks (response time stable over time)
```

**⚠️ Warning Signs**
```
- p95 Response > 1000ms at 50 concurrent users
- Error rate 5-15%
- Response times increasing over test duration
- Memory usage growing continuously
```

**🔴 Critical Issues**
```
- p95 Response > 2000ms at 50 concurrent users
- Error rate > 20%
- System crashes or becomes unresponsive
- Cannot handle 50 concurrent users
```

### Performance Optimization Recommendations

**If Response Times Too Slow:**
1. Profile application code (identify hot paths)
2. Optimize database queries
3. Implement caching (Redis, CDN)
4. Enable HTTP compression
5. Reduce payload sizes

**If Error Rate Too High:**
1. Check application logs for errors
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check rate limiting settings
4. Review memory usage
5. Check for connection pool issues

**If Cannot Handle Peak Load:**
1. Implement horizontal scaling
2. Add load balancer
3. Optimize critical paths
4. Implement circuit breakers
5. Use CDN for static assets
